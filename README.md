Kimi is my friend and she recently joined a software company. Her company gave her some online tasks to complete, but she doesnt have much experience in coding. These are some simple javascript exercise I helped with. I do not in particular know much about javascript though, but i am happy to know about it.
These exercises include basic javascript, some jquery (and jquery-ui) and boots
ps. there are lines of japanese and chinese in the comments because she's working in japan :)
